School Buses + 
Charging Stations +
District IT Security +
State School Bus Regulations +
Driver Union Requirements +
Parent Notification Systems +
Student Data Privacy Laws +
Insurance Compliance +
Emergency Response Protocols +
Maintenance Staff Training +
Administrative Approvals = Working Enterprise System
```
**Time needed:** 4-6 weeks ✅
